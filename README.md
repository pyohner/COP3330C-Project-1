The purpose of this program - Sports App - is to create soccer and basketball players and record details of each.
Soccer players will have a name, a number for their jersey, a position, and number of fouls committed.
 - The player's name, number, position, and fouls committed can be set upon creation or left empty.
 - Once created, the player's name, number, position, and number of fouls can be edited.
 - When a player commits a foul, their foul count increments and a message is output.
Basketball players will have a name, the number of points scored, and a free throw conversion rate.
 - The player's name, number of points scored, and free throw conversion rate can be upon creation or left empty.
 - Once created, the player's name, number of points scored, and free throw conversion rate can be edited.
 - A player can score a free throw, two points, or three points to add to their number of points scored.
 - When a player scores, a message confirms the number of points scored.
